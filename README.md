# Fibonacci Sequence
This is my commit about the Fibonacci Sequence!

As I am a new student of software development, I choose this topic (Fibonacci Sequence) as my first challenge to create a program that can generate and store all numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

# Python 3.9.4!

I tried doing on Java, but Java can't handle big integer numbers easily as Python due the limit that the Data Type: "long" have, wich goes from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, limiting the sequence to only 93 terms, but in Python there isn't a limit to integer numbers, the only thing that can limit the code is your computer memory.

# WARNING!
It is not recommended to go above 1,000. After that the code won't be instantaneous and will take more time to generate the next numbers in the sequence!

# Remember: The only limitation to this program is your computer! Be careful! Use with caution!
